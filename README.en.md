Files beginning with the numbers 1000 through represent machines that have been completed and shipped to the demonstration.
Each number represents an individual machine.
The code for 1000 in particular has been rewritten as a template.

Files starting with tunnel_ are used for tunnel inspections developed in collaboration with Nishimatsu Construction Co.
Unit 1004 is not included in the numbering because it is this tunnel model.

The old directory is stored only locally on the server and is excluded from git management.

## Installation
You can download it by `Download ZIP` in an arbitrary directory or by `git clone`.
Open `.ino` with the Arduino IDE; the installation of the Arduino IDE is not described here.
```
git clone https://github.com/nakayama-software/arduino_programs.git
```
## Writing a program
Select `Arduino Mega or Mega2560` in Arduino IDE and write the program by specifying the port.
