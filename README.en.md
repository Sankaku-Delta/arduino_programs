Files beginning with the numbers 100 through represent machines that have been completed and shipped for demonstration.
Each number represents an individual machine.
The code for 1000 in particular has been rewritten as a template.

Files starting with tunnel_ are used for tunnel inspections developed in collaboration with Nishimatsu Construction Co.
Unit 1004 is not included in the numbering because it is this tunnel model.

old is stored only locally on the server and is excluded from git management.

## Installation
Download the software by `git clone` in an arbitrary directory.
Open `.ino` with Arduino IDE.

## Writing a program
Select `Arduino Mega or Mega2560` in Arduino IDE and write the program by specifying the port.
